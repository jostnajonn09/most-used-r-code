#to replace special characters like "." or "*" you need to escape them with "//" escape characters 
vector <- c("21","34","99*","56","90*", "45*")#replace the "*" here with blank "" and convert to numeric vector
gsub("*$","",vector) #this doesn't work as "*" is special character ,so we need to escape it with "//"
gsub("//*$","",vector) #this gives the expected result
